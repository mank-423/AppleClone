Apple Clone(Landing Page)

First of all the website isn't responsive to other screen sizes.

And second, it's my first cloning of a website.

This is how the website looks.....

It is made using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap5. It's just a landing page with navbar having links of the original website along with other links too..
As the devloper was lazy to enough to not make the whole website and just came up with the landing page alongside the organizing of the code.
Apple Clone talks about clean designing and block structure design which is easy and fun to make.
